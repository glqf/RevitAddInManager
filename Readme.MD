## WORK IN PROCESS

- [ ] Console
- [ ] Add-in Extend for **Autocad** And **Naviswork**

## Summary
Usually, when developing and debugging an addin with RevitAPI, user has to close & re-open Revit each time he/she modifies the addin code and wants to re-compile. But with Add-In Manager, user can modify and run the addin directly without closing & re-opening Revit again and again.

In addition, I open a project to attract talents from all over the world to support development, I'm a person, who loves open source very much and writes code every day as a pleasure.

Some feature include: 
- Add-in tester
- Add-in manager
    - AddInManagerFaceless
    - AddInManagerManual
    - AddInManagerReadOnly
    - Application
- Startup manager
- Quick create `.addin` and load to `Revit`
- Clear Cache saved in temp folder
- Quick remove an Add-in not used in working process
